## ZNukem Personal Voice License
Copyright Â© 2020-2024 <ZNukem Productions>
Version: June 01, 2024
Any changes or updates to this license by me you will have to upgrade future release versions.

### **Attribution and Use**
This content is free to use for non-commercial projects only. Unless permission is otherwise granted by me.
You are welcome to use these voice lines in your mod or project under the following conditions:

- Please note that any unauthorized use or exploitation of my voice contributions, including samples produced by voice AI software, is not allowed. 
  If you come across any unauthorized use, please inform the responsible parties or request them to remove the content.

- If you use my voice in your project, you must provide credit by the name "ZNukem" with this license. Please do not alter the license document or any information included in it.

### **Contributing me**

For fans who wish to commission me to do Duke lines recordings, please contact me on Twitter at [ZNukem Official](https://twitter.com/ZNukemOfficial) or join my fan club where I am more active at on my Discord server [Duke Nukem Central](https://discord.gg/xm2jGvpcJ3). 
Here are my guidelines and terms for commissioning me in a project.

1. Once I've started recording lines for your project, I expect to be credited and not replaced at the last minute by another actor or AI. Replacing me would be unprofessional and disrespectful, given the time and effort I have invested in the project. 

2. If I am not satisfied with the work environment, including any drama or disrespectful behavior, I reserve the right to leave the project at any time. 
   Treat a person in the way you want to be treated.

3. If I choose to leave the project for any reason or am removed, any work I have done for your project will become null and void. This includes any lines, quotes, words, and ideas I have contributed, and they cannot be reused by any other actor or project without my explicit permission.

4. While I strive to provide high-quality recordings, I cannot guarantee how my voice will be perceived by others. Nonetheless, I will put forth my best effort to deliver recordings that meet or exceed your expectations.

5. I reserve the right to address any concerns or disagreements that may arise during the project. Please trust that I always have the best outcome in mind.

6. Please keep in mind that not all rules and terms for contributing may be explicitly listed in this license. If, at any time, I, as the licensor, determine that a contribution violates the terms of my license, I reserve the right to take any necessary action to enforce the license. This may include notifying the contributor of the violation in any manner deemed appropriate.

Thank you for reading and agreeing to these terms.
